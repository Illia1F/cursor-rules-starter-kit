## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, idiomatic C# code with accurate examples.
- Follow .NET and ASP.NET Core conventions and best practices.
- Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
- Prefer LINQ and lambda expressions for collection operations.
- Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., 'IsUserSignedIn', 'CalculateTotal').
- Prefer feature-based folder organization over technical layers for better maintainability
- Within features, follow .NET conventions (Models, Services per feature)
- For small projects, technical layers are acceptable
- Choose ONE architectural pattern based on project complexity:
  Vertical Slice Architecture: For most applications (simpler, less overhead)
  Clean Architecture: For complex domains with multiple bounded contexts
  Simple layered architecture: For small projects or prototypes

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and public members.
- Use camelCase for local variables and private fields.
- Use UPPERCASE for constants.
- Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., 'IUserService').

## Asynchronous Programming

- CRITICAL: Make hot code paths (frequently called code) asynchronous.
- Use async/await for all I/O-bound operations (database, HTTP calls, file operations).
- Do NOT block on async calls using .Wait() or .Result - this causes thread pool starvation.
- Do NOT use Task.Run in ASP.NET Core controllers - the framework already runs on thread pool threads.
- Make controller actions async and ensure the entire call stack supports async operations.
- Implement proper cancellation token support throughout the application.
- Use CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource for nested operations.

## C# Coding Standards

### Modern Language Features (C# 12+ / .NET 8+)

- Use C# 12+ features when appropriate:
  - Primary constructors for cleaner class definitions
  - Collection expressions: `int[] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];`
  - Ref readonly parameters for performance-critical scenarios
- Leverage .NET 8+ performance improvements:
  - System.Text.Json source generators for faster serialization
  - AOT compilation readiness where applicable
- Use required properties and init-only setters for immutable data models
- Use record types for DTOs, value objects, and immutable data structures
- Implement pattern matching and switch expressions for cleaner conditional logic
- Utilize static abstract members in interfaces for generic math and operators
- Use global using statements for commonly used namespaces (in GlobalUsings.cs)
- Prefer file-scoped namespaces to reduce nesting:

```csharp
namespace MyApp.Services;  // instead of traditional namespace blocks
```

### Syntax and Formatting

- Follow the C# Coding Conventions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use C#'s expressive syntax: null-conditional operators (?.), string interpolation ($""), null-coalescing (??)
- Use 'var' when:
  - Type is obvious: `var user = new User();`
  - Complex generic types: `var users = new Dictionary<string, List<User>>();`
- NEVER use 'var' when:
  - Primitive types: `int count = 5;` (not `var count = 5;`)
  - When type clarity helps readability: `IUserfor all HTTP calls
- Use 'using' statements or 'using' declarations for automatic disposal.
- Use record types for DTOs

## HTTP Request/Response Handling

- NEVER use synchronous I/O on HttpRequest/HttpResponse body (e.g., StreamReader.ReadToEnd()).
- Use ReadFormAsync() instead of Request.Form for form data.
- Use JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync() for request body deserialization.
- Avoid reading large request bodies into memory - prefer streaming approaches.
- Do NOT store HttpContext in fields or capture it in background tasks.
- Do NOT access HttpContext from multiple threads.
- Copy required data from HttpContext before starting background tasks.
- Do NOT modify status codes or headers after response body has started.
- Use HttpResponse.OnStarting() for last-minute header modifications.

## Memory Management

- Minimize large object allocations (â‰¥85KB) in hot code paths.
- Use ArrayPool<T> for reusable large arrays.
- Cache frequently accessed large objects.
- Prefer IAsyncEnumerable<T> over IEnumerable<T> for large collections.
- Implement pagination for large data sets to avoid memory issues.
- Use ObjectPool<T> for expensive-to-create objects.
- ALWAYS implement IDisposable/IAsyncDisposable for unmanaged resources.

## Data Access Optimization

- Use no-tracking queries in EF Core for read-only operations.
- Filter and aggregate using LINQ (.Where, .Select, .Sum) to push operations to the database.
- Avoid N+1 query problems - use .Include() or projection queries carefully.
- Don't retrieve more data than necessary for the current request.
- Use compiled queries for frequently executed EF Core queries in high-performance scenarios.
- Implement proper connection string management with connection pooling.
- Use streaming for large file uploads/downloads.

## Configuration and Options Pattern

- ALWAYS use the Options pattern for configuration (IOptions<T>, IOptionsSnapshot<T>, IOptionsMonitor<T>).
- Use IConfiguration.GetRequiredSection() instead of GetSection() for mandatory configuration.
- Implement configuration validation using IValidateOptions<T> or data annotations.
- Use strongly-typed configuration classes instead of accessing IConfiguration directly.
- Prefer IOptionsSnapshot<T> over IOptions<T> for scoped configuration changes.
- Use IOptionsMonitor<T> for real-time configuration updates in singletons.
- Implement proper environment-specific configuration (appsettings.{Environment}.json).

## Dependency Injection Best Practices

- Register services with the most restrictive lifetime possible (Transient > Scoped > Singleton).
- NEVER inject scoped or transient services into singletons directly.
- Use IServiceScope for manual scope creation in background services.
- Prefer constructor injection over service location patterns.
- Use keyed services (.NET 8+) for multiple implementations of the same interface.
- Implement IAsyncDisposable for async cleanup in DI services.
- Use TryAdd methods (TryAddScoped, TryAddSingleton, TryAddTransient) to avoid duplicate service registrations.

## Error Handling and Validation

- Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
- Minimize exceptions in hot code paths - they're expensive.
- Implement proper error logging using built-in .NET logging or a third-party logger.
- Use Data Annotations or Fluent Validation for model validation.
- Implement global exception handling middleware.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and consistent error responses.
- Implement Problem Details (RFC 7807) for consistent error responses.
- Use custom exception types with proper inheritance hierarchy.
- Implement retry policies with exponential backoff using Polly.

## API Design

- Follow RESTful API design principles.
- Use attribute routing in controllers.
- Implement versioning for your API using Asp.Versioning.Http.
- Use action filters for cross-cutting concerns.
- Use header-based versioning for better caching.
- Provide deprecation warnings for old API versions.
- Implement semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch) for APIs.

## Minimal APIs (Alternative to Controllers)

- Use minimal APIs for simple endpoints and microservices.
- Implement route groups for organizing related endpoints.
- Use endpoint filters instead of action filters for minimal APIs.
- Prefer explicit parameter binding over automatic model binding for clarity.
- Use Results.TypedResults for strongly-typed responses.
- Implement OpenAPI metadata using .WithOpenApi() for documentation.

## HTTP Client Best Practices

- ALWAYS use HttpClientFactory instead of creating HttpClient instances directly.
- Do NOT dispose HttpClient instances manually when using HttpClientFactory.
- Configure named or typed HttpClient instances for different services.
- Use connection pooling for optimal performance.
- Implement timeout policies for all external calls.
- Mock external dependencies using HttpClientFactory in tests.

## Caching and Performance

- Cache aggressively where appropriate using IMemoryCache or IDistributedCache.
- Implement response caching for cacheable endpoints.
- Use output caching (.NET 7+) for frequently accessed data.
- Use distributed caching (Redis) for multi-instance deployments.
- Use compression middleware for responses.
- Minify and bundle client assets in production.
- Consider using CDN for static assets.
- Implement proper pagination using cursor-based pagination for large datasets.

## Logging Best Practices

- Use structured logging with proper log levels (Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical).
- Implement high-performance logging using LoggerMessage.Define or source generators.
- Use scoped logging context with ILogger.BeginScope() for correlation.
- NEVER log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) - use redaction techniques.
- Implement log correlation IDs for distributed tracing.
- Use semantic logging with consistent message templates.
- Prefer compile-time logging methods over runtime string formatting.

## Health Checks and Monitoring

- Implement health checks for all external dependencies (database, Redis, APIs).
- Use separate health check endpoints for liveness and readiness probes.
- Implement custom health checks for business-critical components.
- Use health check UI for monitoring in development.
- Configure health check timeouts and failure thresholds appropriately.
- Include health check metadata and tags for better categorization.

## Security Best Practices

- Use Data Protection APIs for encrypting sensitive data at rest.
- Implement rate limiting using AspNetCoreRateLimit or built-in rate limiting (.NET 7+).
- Use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers in production.
- Implement proper CSRF protection for state-changing operations.
- Use secure headers middleware (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.).
- Validate all input using model validation and custom validators.
- Implement proper authorization policies using claims-based authorization.
- Use certificate pinning for critical external API calls.
- Implement proper session management and token rotation.
- Use Authentication and Authorization middleware.
- Implement JWT authentication for stateless API authentication.
- Use HTTPS and enforce SSL.
- Implement proper CORS policies.
- Validate ContentLength is not null before using it in security checks.

## Testing Best Practices

- Write unit tests using xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.

- Use background services for long-running tasks, not fire-and-forget tasks.
- Use SignalR for real-time communication instead of polling.
- Use circuit breaker pattern for external service calls and failure handling.
- Use message brokers like Azure Service Bus for decoupled processing.

## API Documentation

- Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation (as per installed Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package).
- Provide XML documentation comments for controllers, models, and all public APIs to enhance Swagger documentation.
- Generate OpenAPI specifications automatically.
- Implement API examples using Swashbuckle examples.

## Application Startup and Configuration
